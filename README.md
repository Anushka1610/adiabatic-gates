# Quantum Computing Project Group3
Coverting adiabatic equantions to quantum circuits.
The main code is the qc_generalied.py

## How to run
1.  Run the provided python code (qc_generalized.py) in an environment withpandas, qiskit and matplotlib.
2.  It will ask for the number of qubits and their weights and strengths in theQUBO.
3.  The final qiskit code will be created in the directory from which the initialpython code was run and it is called qiskitProgram.py.
4.  To run the circuit, execute python3 qiskitProgram.py.
5.  Give the input values for the qubits, the circuit will execute on the localsimulator for 1024 times and give the counts of all of the measured outputs

Basic boolean QUBOs are given in the report3.pdf. The QUBOs for AND, OR, NOR, NAND, XOR, Half-adder and Full-adder are given.
